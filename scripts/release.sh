# Usage: ./scripts/release.sh v2.0.2
#
# Ships unsigned builds. Users must right-click → Open or run
# `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` on first launch. Gatekeeper + the
# Homebrew cask's postflight handle this transparently.
#
# Signing / notarization were removed after Apple's statusCode 7000
# server-side issue kept recurring and blocking releases.

# binary to Intel Mac users — who then see "Code Island can't be opened"
# with no recoverable error (xattr won't help, it's a pure architecture
# mismatch). Force a universal build so the same zip works on both archs.

#    scans Bundle.main.resourceURL/Plugins in addition to the user plugins dir,
